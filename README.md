# RAVr

A small game I started making to learn more about canvas, to strengthen my JavaScript and to brush up on my trigonometry.

Note Sept 6, 2017: I decided to start over from scratch. This whole thing started as an improvised project, and the things I wanted to add increased exponentially as I went along, until it got to the point where I just didn't feel like touching the code anymore. I still feel it has potential though, both as a learning opportunity for myself, and in terms of its value as a game. Flying the ship is fun, and I want to make it a more complete experience. I also changed the name to RAVr. I'll come up with what the acronym means later.

Note Sept 28, 2017: For the most part, I've re-implemented most of the features from the old version, and added a whole lot more. I'm still keeping the old version in here, for reference.

Note Oct 27, 2017: I'm removing the old code from the master branch. I'll keep it around in other branches for now. Download those if you want to try older versionsn of the game.

- Destroy threats to protect buildings. _(Not implemented)_
- Don't die. _(Not implemented)_

## Controls

Implemented so far:

__T__ - Turn on ship  
__Y__ - Turn generator on/off  
__U, I, H__ - Activate and deactivate shields, weapons and harvesting coils. Atm does nothing except change the power drain from the generator.  
__O, K, M__ - Set generator load to 100%, 50% and 0% respectively  
__P, L__ - Increase and decrease generator load  
__W__ - Main thruster  
__A__ - Turn counter-clockwise  
__D__ - Turn clockwise
