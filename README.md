# RAVr

A small game I started making to learn more about canvas, to strengthen my JavaScript and to brush up on my trigonometry.

Note Sept 6, 2017: I decided to start over from scratch. This whole thing started as an improvised project, and the things I wanted to add increased exponentially as I went along, until it got to the point where I just didn't feel like touching the code anymore. I still feel it has potential though, both as a learning opportunity for myself, and in terms of its value as a game. Flying the ship is fun, and I want to make it a more complete experience. I also changed the name to RAVr. I'll come up with what the acronym means later.

Note Sept 28, 2017: For the most part, I've re-implemented most of the features from the old version, and added a whole lot more. I'm still keeping the old version in here, for reference.
