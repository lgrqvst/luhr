# RAVr

**Update Jan 21, 2019:** Ok, here we go. Doing this again. From the beginning. With React this time. Let's see how far we get. There probably won't be anything playable for a while, but when there is, oh boy, I'll be sure to let you know.

~~A small game I started making to learn more about canvas, to strengthen my JavaScript and to brush up on my trigonometry.~~

~~Note Sept 6, 2017: I decided to start over from scratch. This whole thing started as an improvised project, and the things I wanted to add increased exponentially as I went along, until it got to the point where I just didn't feel like touching the code anymore. I still feel it has potential though, both as a learning opportunity for myself, and in terms of its value as a game. Flying the ship is fun, and I want to make it a more complete experience. I also changed the name to RAVr. I'll come up with what the acronym means later.~~

~~Note Sept 28, 2017: For the most part, I've re-implemented most of the features from the old version, and added a whole lot more. I'm still keeping the old version in here, for reference.~~

~~Note Oct 27, 2017: I'm removing the old code from the master branch. I'll keep it around in other branches for now. Download those if you want to try older versionsn of the game~~

~~Play the game [here](https://lgrqvst.github.io/ravr/build/)~~

## Objectives

I'm still working these out.

- ~~Gather macguffins with your ship, then land and return them to base. _(Not implemented)_~~
- ~~Occasionally land in the forest for whatever reason. _(Not implemented)_~~
- ~~Destroy threats to protect buildings. _(Not implemented)_~~
- ~~Don't die. _(Not implemented)_~~

## Controls

We'll see.

~~Implemented so far:~~

~~**T** - Turn on ship~~  
~~**Y** - Turn generator on/off~~  
~~**U, I, H** - Activate and deactivate shields, weapons and harvesting coils. Atm does nothing except change the power drain from the generator.~~  
~~**O, K, M** - Set generator load to 100%, 50% and 0% respectively~~  
~~**P, L** - Increase and decrease generator load~~  
~~**W** - Main thruster~~  
~~**A** - Turn counter-clockwise~~  
~~**D** - Turn clockwise~~  
~~**S** - Boost (Drains engine power quicky)~~
