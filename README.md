A small game to learn more about canvas, to strengthen my JavaScript and to brush up on my trigonometry.

## TO DO

### Ship
- [ ] Fuel
- [ ] Particles restore fuel
- [ ] Thrusters
- [ ] Thruster exhaust
- [ ] Landing gear
- [ ] Adjust behaviour when craft is in contact with the ground, like rolling, rather than stopping abruptly
- [ ] Weapon turret
- [ ] Ammunition types
- [ ] AoE weapon
- [ ] Make flight dependent on presence of particles
- [ ] Health / HP
- [ ] Explosion upon death
- [ ] Craft breaks apart on crash
- [ ] Render a copy of the craft on the other side when crossing over horizontally

### Environment

- [ ] Air resistance slows down horizontal movement
- [ ] Wind
- [ ] Particle pulsation
- [ ] Particle regeneration
- [ ] Obstacles
- [ ] Enemies
- [ ] Terrain
- [ ] No-particle areas
- [ ] Sparks when exhaust touches terrain
- [ ] Smoke in addition to sparks
- [ ] Make terrain dangerous to touch
- [ ] Safe landing pads
- [ ] Power-ups

### Game

- [ ] Sounds
- [ ] Music
- [ ] UI
- [ ] Intro
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Pause screen
- [ ] Help screen
- [ ] Missions (maybe just randomizing the environment)
- [ ] Check that math again.
- [ ] Structure and clean up code. Make it conform to best practices.

### Stretch goals (if I have time and energy)

- [ ] Add some sort of story elements (cutscenes? dialogue? npcs? maybe randomize it?)
